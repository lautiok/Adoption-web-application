# Adoption web applicationüò∫üê∂

This website is dedicated to pet adoption. Their goals are to increase online visibility so that animals can be adopted and find a family as soon as possible. To achieve this, we have followed good SEO (Search Engine Positioning) development and optimization practices, ensuring that the search is quick and easy.

The website is intuitive and easy to use. The home page is focused squarely on adoption, so users will see our pets up for adoption as soon as they enter the site.

Clicking the Adopt button next to a pet will open a view with detailed information about it. If the user decides to adopt, they will be directed to a contact form, where they will be asked to enter their contact details and a brief description of why they wish to adopt the selected pet.


## Development

We handle the complete development of the website, both the backend and the frontend. For the frontend, we use React.js, and for the backend, we use Node.js. Below are the technologies employed:

- Express: Framework for building web applications and APIs.
- Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) for MongoDB, facilitating interaction with the database.
- bcrypt: Library for password hashing.
- Cloudinary: Image management and storage service.
- cookie-parser: Middleware for handling cookies.
- cors: Middleware to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
- express-fileupload: Middleware for uploading files.
- fs: Module for working with the file system.
- jsonwebtoken: Library for generating and verifying JWT (JSON Web Tokens) tokens.
- zod: Library for validation and definition of data schemas.

Frontend:

- axios: HTTP client for making requests to the API.
- cookie: Tool for handling cookies in the browser.
- formik: Library for managing forms in React.
- yup: Schema validation library, used together with Formik.
- react-hook-form: Library for forms, optimized for state management and validation.
- react-router-dom: Tool for handling routing in React applications.
- react-select: Component for creating customizable selectors in forms.

Create Adoption (createAdopt):

When a POST request is made to the /api/pets route, the createAdopt function is executed. This function receives the data of the pet to be adopted from the request body (req.body), including name, age, gender, type, description, and status. If an image of the pet is provided, it is uploaded through the uploadImage function, stored in the cloud, and the URL is saved in the database. A new adoption record is created in the database using the provided data. An HTTP 201 response is returned with the details of the created adoption.

Get All Adoptions (getAdopts):

When a GET request is made to the /api/pets route, the getAdopts function is executed. This function searches for all pet adoptions in the database using the Adopt model. It returns an HTTP 200 response with the list of all adoptions found.

Get Specific Adoption (getAdopt):

When a GET request is made to the /api/pets/
route, the getAdopt function is executed. This function searches for a specific adoption by its ID in the database using the Adopt model. It returns an HTTP 200 response with the details of the found adoption.

Update Adoption (updateAdopt):

User Registration (register):

When a POST request is made to the /api/session/register route, the register function is executed. This function receives the data of name, email, and password of the new user from the request body (req.body). It checks if the email is already registered in the database. If it already exists, it returns an error. It encrypts the user's password using bcrypt and saves the new user in the database.

If the token is present, it verifies its validity using the jsonwebtoken module and the secret key defined in process.env.JWT_SECRET. If the token is valid, it searches for and returns the details of the user in the database. If no valid token or associated user is found, it returns an HTTP 401 status code.
